# Roadmap

Through our interviews and direct collaboration on key projects, we identified
the common motifs to create Element Calcium Imaging. Major features include:

- [x] Ingestion of scan metadata, also compatible with mesoscale imaging and
  multi-ROI scanning mode
- [x] Tables for all processing steps: motion correction, cell segmentation, 
  fluorescence trace extraction, spike inference, and cell classification
- [x] Store different curations of the segmentation results
- [x] Ingestion of data acquired with ScanImage, Scanbox, Nikon NIS-Elements, and
  Bruker Prairie View acquisition systems
- [x] Ingestion of processing outputs from both Suite2p and CaImAn analysis suites
- [x] Sample data and complete test suite for quality assurance
- [x] Cell extraction with the EXTRACT analysis package
- [x] Quality metrics
- [ ] Data compression
- [ ] Deepinterpolation
- [x] Data export to NWB
- [x] Data publishing to DANDI

Further development of this Element is community driven. Upon user requests and based on
guidance from the Scientific Steering Group we will continue adding features to this 
Element.
